Tensorflow Python
===========

This is my simple playground for Tensorflow Python
follow https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_mac for installation on Mac. I am using Python 2.7 
with the latest Tensorflow version
Most of the examples are my attempts to learn Tensorflow and specyfy where they come from.
The most useful ones are in Tensorflow tutorial folder and show how to export graph
reflecting the training results.
Additioanally TensorflowBoard and Polynomial regression ones are integrated with
Tensorflow board - Python application very usefull for viewing graph and results
of training.
